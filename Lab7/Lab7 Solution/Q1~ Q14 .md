# Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

## What is RBAC in Kubernetes?
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users or service accounts. It provides fine-grained control over who can access which resources and perform specific actions, ensuring security and reducing the risk of unauthorized actions.

## Main Components of RBAC in Kubernetes

1. **Roles**: Define a set of permissions for resources within a specific namespace.
2. **ClusterRoles**: Similar to Roles, but apply across all namespaces or for cluster-wide resources.
3. **RoleBindings**: Link a Role to a specific user, group, or service account within a namespace.
4. **ClusterRoleBindings**: Link a ClusterRole to users, groups, or service accounts cluster-wide.

## Roles vs. ClusterRoles in Kubernetes

- **Roles**: Are namespace-scoped, meaning they grant permissions only within a single namespace.
- **ClusterRoles**: Are cluster-wide and can grant permissions for cluster-wide resources or resources in all namespaces.

## What is a RoleBinding, and How Does it Differ from a ClusterRoleBinding?

- **RoleBinding**: Grants permissions defined in a Role to a subject (user, group, or service account) within a specific namespace.
- **ClusterRoleBinding**: Grants permissions defined in a ClusterRole to subjects across all namespaces or for cluster-wide resources.

## How to List All Roles and RoleBindings in a Specific Namespace

You can list all the Roles and RoleBindings in a specific namespace with the following commands:

```bash
kubectl get roles -n <namespace>
kubectl get rolebindings -n <namespace>
```

## ClusterRoleBindings for Granting Permissions Across the Cluster

A **ClusterRoleBinding** links a ClusterRole to subjects across the entire cluster, allowing users or service accounts to access cluster-wide resources or resources in any namespace.

## Subjects in RBAC

Subjects represent entities (users, groups, or service accounts) to whom the permissions are granted in RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings. The types of subjects include:

- **User**: A single user identity.
- **Group**: A collection of users.
- **ServiceAccount**: A service account used by Pods to interact with the Kubernetes API.

## Check Permissions of a Particular User or Service Account

You can check the permissions of a user or service account with the following command:

```bash
kubectl auth can-i <verb> <resource> --as=<user> -n <namespace>
```

## Significance of `aggregate-to-admin`, `aggregate-to-edit`, and `aggregate-to-view` Labels

These labels are used in ClusterRoles to automatically aggregate permissions:
- **aggregate-to-admin**: Grants admin-level permissions.
- **aggregate-to-edit**: Grants permissions to edit resources.
- **aggregate-to-view**: Grants read-only access to resources.

## Advanced RBAC and External Integration

### Kubernetes RBAC and External Identity Providers

RBAC can integrate with external identity providers (e.g., LDAP, OIDC) via authentication plugins. Once a user is authenticated, RBAC controls what resources they can access based on their roles.

### Troubleshooting RBAC Permission Errors

Common steps to troubleshoot RBAC issues include:
1. Checking Role or ClusterRole definitions.
2. Verifying RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings.
3. Using `kubectl auth can-i` to check specific permissions.

**Common issues**: Incorrect namespace, missing RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding, and incorrect resource names or verbs.

### Granting Temporary Elevated Privileges

You can create a temporary RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding with elevated privileges. However, this can have security implications, as elevated permissions must be revoked promptly to avoid misuse.

### RBAC vs. ServiceAccount Permissions

RBAC controls what actions users and service accounts can perform. **ServiceAccount** permissions are specific to what Pods can do within the cluster.

- **ServiceAccounts** are used by Pods to interact with the Kubernetes API, and RBAC policies can be used to restrict these interactions.
